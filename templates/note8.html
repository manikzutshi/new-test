I wouldn’t like it if you weren’t around. Even though you’re always just
a text away, it’s not the same as having you right beside me like before.
I miss the little things—how your presence instantly makes my day feel
lighter, how just hearing your voice in person brings a kind of comfort
that no message ever could, no matter how many times I read your words.

I miss the way you hug me, the way you hold me close, how everything
feels softer, warmer, and safer when you're there, right where I need you.
Your scent, your smile, the way you laugh when you're genuinely happy—
it’s all etched into my mind, and when you’re not around, I find myself
longing for those moments again, replaying them like my favorite song.

I think about the times we’ve sat together, how natural it feels to just
exist beside you in the quiet, no words needed, just us. No matter how
many people I may be around, it’s never the same as being around you.

You are my safe space, my person, the one who makes everything feel right.
And when I can’t be with you, I count down every second until I can again.
