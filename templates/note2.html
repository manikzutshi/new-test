Some moments don’t need words—they just happen, slow and effortless,
like they were always meant to be. The first time we held hands was one
of those moments. It was in the library, quiet and calm, yet my heart was
anything but. You placed your hand near mine, just close enough to make
me wonder if it was on purpose. And then, inch by inch, minute by minute,
our fingers found each other. A pinky at first, then two, until finally, my
hand wrapped around yours, like it was always supposed to.

We stayed like that for what felt like forever, the warmth of your hand
sinking into mine. It was summer, and soon, our palms grew sticky with
sweat, making me chuckle as I whispered, "This would be better in winter."
You giggled, and in that tiny, fleeting moment, the world shrank to just us—
our hands intertwined, our laughter soft, and a feeling I never wanted to
let go of.
