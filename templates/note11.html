I promise to always remind you of how incredible you truly are, even on days  
when you don’t see it yourself. You get excited over the smallest things, you  
celebrate the tiniest victories like they’re the biggest achievements, and that  
is something I adore about you more than words can ever express. No matter how  
chaotic things get—whether it's you speaking in riddles or us piecing together  
conversations—
I will always cherish every little quirk that makes you who you are.  
I promise to be your safe place, the person you can always count on, just like  
you are for me. I will keep every memory close—our first time holding hands in  
the library, our first date at Mr. DIY, the moments when time slows down and it  
feels like it’s just us against the world. I will never stop appreciating you,  
never take you for granted, and never let you feel alone, 
no matter what happens.  
I promise to love you, not just in the easy moments, but in the ones that test  
us, that challenge us, that shape us into something even stronger. I promise to  
keep choosing you, over and over again,
for as long as you’ll have me by your side.  
And I promise, no matter what happens, you will always, always have my heart.
