I hope I haven’t annoyed you too much over all these years, and that you
still smile when you think of all our silly little moments together. I hope
time has been kind to you, that life has given you reasons to smile often,
and that you're happy with everything you’ve accomplished so far in life.

If you’re still chasing dreams, I’m cheering for you, just like I always did.
If you’ve already found your place, then I’m so incredibly proud of you, my
love. You deserve every bit of happiness that life has ever given your way.

Most of all, I hope we’re still walking this path together, successful in our
own ways but even stronger as a team, growing just like we always dreamed.
Maybe by now, we’re living together, building a future, maybe even married—
god, that makes me blush, but it’s a thought that never fails to make me smile.

Wherever you are, whatever moment this finds you in, know that I love you
just as much as I do right now, maybe even more, in ways words cannot say.
And if you’re reading this while I’m not around, then I miss you, my love,
just like I always do when you’re not here, wishing I could hold you again.
