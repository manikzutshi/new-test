I went to IISF excited for the event, but the moment I saw you, everything
else just… faded. I don’t know how to explain it—one second, I was there
for the science, and the next, I was completely mesmerized by you.
I just knew you were older than me, and honestly? That only made you more
captivating. But what truly got me—what completely stole my attention—
were your eyes. Hazel, different from anyone else’s, shining even in the
winter light. I couldn’t stop looking, couldn’t stop thinking, oh my god,
she’s so pretty. You had this small, adorable face, wrapped up in winter
clothes, and something about that made you even more irresistible to me.
And god, I wanted to talk to you. I’m not the kind of person who approaches
people first, but that day? I just had to. I spent the whole day hoping for
a chance, anything to start a conversation with you. Then, finally, when we
were in the bus, I blurted out something—random, probably dumb, but it
didn’t matter. You responded. And that was it. That was my chance at last.
I asked if I could sit next to you, if the seat beside you was free. And
when you said yes… oh my god. I was over the moon. I tried to play it cool,
but inside, I was just losing my mind. The moment I had been manifesting
since the morning actually happened, right at the end of the day. And it
was perfect in every possible way.
