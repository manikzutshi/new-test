Not just because of how breathtakingly beautiful you are, with your
mesmerizing eyes, your soft hair, and the scent of your skin that I
could recognize anywhere. Not just because of the way your perfume
lingers when you walk by or how your moisturizer somehow smells like
home. I love you for all of that, yes—but so much more than just that.
I love you because of the way you smile at the smallest things, the
way you laugh, and because of how effortlessly adorable you always
are. You make the simplest moments feel like magic, like something
out of a dream. You are warmth, you are comfort, you are the softest
place my heart has ever known, my safest and most cherished haven.
And if I could, I’d hold you forever, wrapped in your arms, where the
world feels a little less chaotic and a little more like my true home.
I know I can be hard to deal with sometimes. I keep my thoughts locked
away, I struggle to express what I feel, but somehow, you understand.
You have the patience to stay, to listen, to care—even when I don’t
always make it easy. And for that, my love, I adore you even more. So
if you ever wonder why I love you—just know, there are infinite reasons,
and each day, I find more, and I will keep finding more, forever.
